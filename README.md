# UniOfPiraeusMScThesisProject

This is my thesis project for my conversion MSc course in Informatics at Uni. of Piraeus 2021.

Project is done in Python. Aim is to develop and test a MLP neural network model and a Support vector machine model to identify the sphere size distribution of materials based on 1D NMRI k-space data. Simulated data are used in this project.

This project's main idea is based on my previous PhD work. Relevant publication can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2015.09.066
This projects extends previous work hich used a custom mae Bayesian classifier to include MLP neural networks and SVM regression models.
